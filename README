npyck creates a shell skript which loads a python project...
all python source files are appended to the shell skript 
in a compressed zip file.

it's easy to use:
let's say we got 2 source files, main.py and other.py
just call ./npyck.py main.py other.py -o packet.sh

now ./packet.sh *  should have the same effects as python main.py *

supports only unix like operating systems, (it would work on windows if you had a shell...)

things to check/fix
  * --all flag + some extra files? What about adding a file twice...
